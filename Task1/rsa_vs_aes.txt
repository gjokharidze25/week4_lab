Differences between RSA and AES

Algorithm type
- RSA is asymmetric
- AES is symmetric

Performance
- RSA is mathematically heavy
- AES is very fast and optimized

Use-case
- RSA is typically used to protect small pieces of data: keys, session secrets, certificates.
- AES is used to protect the actual bulk data
